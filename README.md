This paper explores the performance of recommender system algorithms, particularly contrasting classical models with neural network-based models across a range of beyond-accuracy metrics. Building on the work of Ferrari Dacrema et al., it confirms that simpler baseline models outperform their more complex neural network counterparts not only in accuracy but also in novelty, diversity, coverage, unexpectedness, and serendipity.
